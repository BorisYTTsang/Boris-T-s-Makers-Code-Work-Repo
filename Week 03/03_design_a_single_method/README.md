Some exercises requiring designs and test suites for example user stories.

reading_time = user wants a program for time management that tells them 
how long a passage of text will take them to read.

sentence_checker = user wants a program that helps them to catch grammar
mistakes. Checks for capitalisation and correct sentence ending punctuation
omissions and corrects user.

todo_checker = user wants a program that helps them identify tasks within
memos that need to be done. Searches for a substring "#TODO" and returns
true/false.
