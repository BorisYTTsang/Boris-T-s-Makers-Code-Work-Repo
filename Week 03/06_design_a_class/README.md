The user wants a program that allows them to see
a list of the music tracks they've listened to.

I went a bit further and implemented a list of 
tracks per artist, in which I utilised an array of
hashes, which then contained a list of songs as
each hash value.

Manipulating data in this form was rather
challenging, though, and tested my knowledge of
array, hash and enumerable methods/syntax.
