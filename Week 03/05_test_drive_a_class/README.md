Test driven development of a pair of single class programs.

The first, diary_entry, is based on the reading_time app.
It allows the user to store in a DiaryEntry class, which
can return the title and contents of the entry, as well as
counting the words in the entry and returning the chunk of
the entry that is readable based on the user's reading speed
and how much time they have to read.

The second, grammar_stats, is based on the sentence_checker app.
It allows the user to see what percentage of all sentences
they've typed is grammatically correct, based on the two
sentence_checker conditions.
(Not fully complete, but passes all tests.)
