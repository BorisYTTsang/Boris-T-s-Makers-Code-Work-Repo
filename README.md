# Boris T's Makers Code Work Repo
My repository for code work, technical learning and other evidence of work/learning for Makers.

My main Retro Diary blog is over at https://borisatmakers.wordpress.com/

This is where all the code that I have written for the Makers Bootcamp, not to mention other
technical details and evidence of work and learning, is.

All materials are organised by Week from 1 to 12, with subfolders therein.
