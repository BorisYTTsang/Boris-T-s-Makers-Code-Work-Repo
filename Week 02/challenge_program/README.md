This is my first programming challenge. 
It took the fragments we were drilled on and combined them 
into a cohesive program with a basic function - to validate
a password so that it contains at least 8 characters and 
contains at least of of the following characters:- 
"!", "@", "$", "%", "&".

A good test of fundamental understanding!
