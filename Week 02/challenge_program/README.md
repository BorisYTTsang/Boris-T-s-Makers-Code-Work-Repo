This is my first programming challenge, taking the fragments we were drilled
on and combining it into a cohesive program with a basic function - to validate
a password so that it contains at least 8 characters and contains at least of
of the following characters:- "!", "@", "$", "%", "&".

A good test of fundamental understanding!
